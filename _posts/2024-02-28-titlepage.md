Welcome! I'm Ekaterina (Katya) I. Makarenko, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. I study how supernova remnants and cosmic rays affect energy bidget and affect the chemistry of the interstellar medium, using simulations and theory to connect models with observations.
