Hi! I am Ekaterina (Katya) I. Makarenko and I am a PhD student in Computational Astrophysics at the 1. Institute of Physics in the University of Cologne, Germany in the group of Prof. Stefanie Walch. 
I do theory and simulations studying aspects of the life of massive stars on different time and space scales.
